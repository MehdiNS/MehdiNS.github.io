                          **Notes on Topology and Functional Analysis**

## Metric spaces

!!! Note
    A **metric space** $(X,d)$ is a set $X$ and a metric $d$ on the set $X$.
In simpler words, a metric space is a set in which it makes sense to compute distance between elements.

Why do we care about metric spaces ? They are a major building block in analysis. For instance, without the concept of metric in a set, we cannot define the notion of convergence

!!! Note
    A **metric** on a set $X$ is a function $d : X \times X \mapsto \Real$, satisfying 3 properties : 
    - Nonnegativity : $\forall x,y \in X, d(x,y) \geq 0$. Also, $d(x,y) = 0$ iff $x=y$
    - Symmetry : $\forall x,y \in X, d(x,y) = d(y,x)$
    - Triangular inequality : $\forall x,y,z \in X, d(x,y) + d(y,z) \geq d(x,z)$

!!! Tip
    Examples : 

    a) The standard distance between two real numbers $d(x,y) = |x-y|$ on the $\Real$ line is a metric space

    b) Let $x=(x_1, x_2)$ and $y=(y_1, y_2)$. The Euclidean distance $d(x,y) = \sqrt{(x_1 - y_1)^2+(x_2 - y_2)^2}$ on the set $\Real^2$ is a metric space

    c) Let $x=(x_1, x_2)$ and $y=(y_1, y_2)$. The distance $d(x,y) = |x_1 - y_1|+|x_2 - y_2|$, called the Manhattan distance, is another metric space on the set $\Real^2$

Euclidean spaces are metric spaces equipped with the standard Euclidean metric

## Open Ball

Let $x_0 \in \Real^n$ and $r \in \Real^+$. 

!!! Note
    An **open ball** of radius $r$ centered at $x_0$, denoted by $B_r(x_0)$, is defined as the set $\{x \in \Real^n | d(x, x_0) < r\}$.

## Classification of points in a set

Let $A$ be any subset of $\Real^n$.

Let $A^c$ be the complement of $A$ relative to $\Real^n$, basically everything that is not in $A$. $A^c$ is a shortcut for the more rigorous $\Real^n \smallsetminus A$.

!!! Note
    A point $x_0 \in A$ is called an **interior point** of $A$, if there exists an open ball $B_r(x_0) \subseteq A$.
    The set of all the interior points of $A$, denoted by $A^o$, is called the **interior of $A$**.

    A point $x_0 \in A^c$ is called an **exterior point** of $A$, if there exists an open ball $B_r(x_0) \subseteq A^c$.
    The set of all the exterior points of $A$, denoted by $A^e$, is called the **exterior of $A$**.

    A point $x_0 \in \Real^n$ is called a **boundary point** of $A$, if in any open ball $B_r(x_0)$, there always exists a point $x_1 \in A$ and a point $x_2 \in A^c$.
    The set of all the boundary points of $A$, denoted by $\partial A$, is called the **boundary of $A$**.

    A point $x_0 \in \Real^n$ is called a **limit point** of $A$, if in any open ball $B_r(x_0)$, there is always a point $x$ other than $x_0$ in $A$.
    The set of all the limit points, denoted by $A'$, is called the **derived set of $A$**.

    A point $x_0 \in A$ is called an **isolated point** of $A$, if there exists an open ball $B_r(x_0)$ in which there is no point $x$ other than $x_0$ in $A$.

    The union of $A$ and its boundary ($A \cup \partial A$), denoted by $\bar{A}$, is called the **closure of $A$**.

!!! Tip
    A lot of definitions here, it might start to get confusing, so a drawing could help :

    ![](PointSet.png)

           | $\in A$? | Interior | Exterior | Boundary | Limit | Isolated
    :-----:|:--------:|:--------:|:--------:|:--------:|:-----:|:--------:
    $p_0$  |    ✓    |    ✓    |    ✗    |    ✗    |   ✓  |    ✗
    $p_1$  |    ✓    |    ✓    |    ✗    |    ✓    |   ✓  |    ✗
    $p_2$  |    ✗    |    ✗    |    ✓    |    ✗    |   ✗  |    ✗
    $p_3$  |    ✓    |    ✓    |    ✗    |    ✓    |   ✗  |    ✓

    The table above sums up the type of points in the drawing

We now have an understanding of the differents types of points in a set. The sets associated to these types of points have some interesting properties

- $A^o \subseteq A' \subseteq \bar{A}$

Proof : 

- $A^o \subseteq A$

Proof : 

- $A^e \subseteq A^c$

Proof : 

- $\Real^n = A^o \cup \partial A \cup A^e$

Proof : 

## Open sets and closed sets

A point set $A \subseteq \Real^n$ is called an **open set**, if for all x \in A, there is an open ball $B_r(x) \subseteq A$.

A point set $A \subseteq \Real^n$ is called a **closed set**, if it contains its entire boundary, namely, $\partial A \subseteq A$.

(1) $A$ is an open set if and only if $A \cap \partial A = \emptyset$.

(2) $A$ is an open set if and only if $A = A^o$.

(3) $A$ is a closed set if and only if $A = \bar{A}$.
